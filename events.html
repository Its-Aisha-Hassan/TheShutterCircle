<!-- NEW COMMENT: Initially, I relied on body id for styling specific pages, but this approach turned out to be tedious and prone to inconsistencies that were difficult to address. Feeling annoyed, I explored other resources and came across this source: https://poe.com/s/fAYkl3Or8zMVTsC8ZGYK, which recommended using classes and wrappers instead. This method helped me overcome the challenges, streamline my CSS, and ensure more consistent styling across the site. -->

<!-- NEW COMMENT: I initially wanted banners at the top of each page (refer to wireframe), but after experimenting, I realized I really disliked how clunky they looked—especially since my site has lots of images in general as a film photography site. So, I decided to go with a cleaner design inspired by Shoot It With Film, where the page title is centered between two lines. To make mine different, I executed it in a way where the title is in between the two lines side by side (refer to website) -->

<!-- NEW COMMENT: Please note that the links I attached do not have the events I listed on my site, but it's just to show that I know how to do that. My goal for this site is for the "Learn More" button to direct viewers to the specific post that the "host" of the event released on social media. However, since the events are obviously fake, the next best thing was to link to the sites/social media pages. -->

<!-- NEW COMMENT: The added use of span class="event-date" is to apply a unique style directly to only what I want without affecting other elements, sort of to give it an emphasis for viewers to glance at when they first enter this page. What is great about it is that it does not involve inline css styling https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_span.asp -->

<!-- While doing up this website, I realised that it may be difficult for notepad++ to link with google services such as google calendar as it is a rather limited and basic developing software. I learnt though that this newfound knowledge only means I will not be making the same mistake again. -->

<!-- NEW COMMENT: I was unable to link google calendar to the site due to notepad's limitations, hence, had to fall back with the assumption that the events are free for all general public. -->

<!-- NEW COMMENT: I also made the conscious decision to do away the rvsp because it can only be done using javascript and that is a little way more advanced than I'm used to and we are not taught in-depth this. Hence, going back to my fallback plan of making the events in my site a free to all with no need for sign ups. -->
