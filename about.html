<!-- I decided to use the <span> attribute on all pages of my website—except the homepage—and i think it'd be a game-changer. For me, it’s all about making things easier for users. When someone navigates to a page that includes this attribute, the corresponding word or link becomes unclickable. It’s a subtle way of saying, "Hey, you’re already here!" Without adding any clutter, it improves navigation by preventing unnecessary clicks. I also did some research and noticed that the <span> attribute would be super handy for styling once we get to make use of CSS. -->

		<!-- I did make the size of some of the first pictures on the pages large and this was intentional if you referred to my wireframes. All photographs were formatted appropriately and while some of the pictures are of a larger file size, it is due to the nature of photography in general as pictures are usually shot raw or straight from the camera in order to preserve the image quality. I believe that since my website is on photographs, it should be fine for a little leeway. -->
			
			<p>The Shutter Circle is a community and platform for people who love film photography. In a world where digital photography is everywhere, we focus on the unique qualities of shooting with film and the skills it takes to work with analog cameras.</p>
			
			<p>Our goal is to bring together photographers of all levels—from beginners to experienced shooters—to share knowledge, tips, and stories about film photography. Whether you’re learning how to use your first 35mm camera or have been developing prints in a darkroom for years, you’ll find helpful resources and a supportive community here.</p>
			
			<p>We offer tutorials, gear advice, and features on different types of film and developing processes. We also highlight photographers’ projects and personal stories to show how film photography is still relevant and inspiring today. The Shutter Circle organizes events like photowalks and workshops to help members connect and learn from each other in person. We believe that being part of a community is important for growth and creativity.</p>
			
			<p>No matter what format or style you prefer, The Shutter Circle is a place to learn, share, and enjoy film photography. Join us and be part of a group that values every shot and every story behind it. </p>

<!-- NEW COMMENT: If you recall, my original plan was to have buttons in the sidebar, inspired by the design approach used by Shoot It With Film, but after dabbling with CSS, I've come to the conclusion that it's just way too advanced for Notepad++, but perhaps in the future, I can make use of other softwares to build upon this site. -->
